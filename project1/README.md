# Particle system

Theme: need a bit of help to get going

All particles are floating around the space, they are lazy,colorless,slow and unorgnized.
Once user starts to move around their cursor, the particles will be dragged into the spinning cirlcr attached to the cursor.
At this point, they become to have color
As time passes, the circle gets bigger and starts to create some beautiful pattern
