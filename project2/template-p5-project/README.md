# Data visualization
This project displays all flight route either national or international for US(There are 2 colors represent each category)
-Every yellow dot symbolizes an airport location. Whenever an airplane is about to take off, the dot will blink for few seconds and then disapear
-All particles are assigned to a random timer between 1 to 100, they will only take off when it reaches 100. Once it arrives at its destination, timer gets reset and it will return to where it came
-I used an api to get the static world map from website.
